hex files use LMAs, which are specified in the linker script, thats why .data ends up being directly after .text in hex file
despite having VMA of 0x800000. The line in linker script responsible is "AT (ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF(.text))" (so .data will
be put in the same address space as .text, theyre both going to flash)
