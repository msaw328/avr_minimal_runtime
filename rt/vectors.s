# macro for defining a vector as a weak symbol
# allows it to be overwriten by a strong symbol
# (for instance in C part of the source code)
# pretty much copied from avr-libc source code
# i can't really think of a better way to handle ISR overwriting
# weak symbols are perfect for that

# the way it works:
# .macro defines a macro "vector" with argument "name" which will be a symbol name (name of the ISR)
# .weak defines a symbol a symbol as weak (can be overwriten by a symbol of same name but strong somewhere else)
# .weak also creates a symbol if it didnt exist before, here we give it the name from the argument
# .set sets value of the symbol to ISR_null, our default ISR
# now the symbols value is ISR_null address, but if anywhere theres another symbol of the same name and its not weak
# the value will be overwritten
# macro then evaluates to a rjmp to the symbol, this way by default its an rjmp to ISR_null, but can be overwritten with custom ISR
